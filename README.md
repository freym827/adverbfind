# adverbfind
adverb finder and deleter

A friend requested of me that I make an app that finds and removes adverbs from text,
hoping that he could review and write papers that were less verbose. 

So that evening I put a little time into this and was able to help him out. 
This was a nice small exercise and review in javascript.
